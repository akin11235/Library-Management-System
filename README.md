# Library Management System in C++

## Project Overview
The Library Management System is a console-based application developed as part of the "Object Oriented Programming" course using C++. The system leverages advanced concepts, including Templates & STL, Class Templates, Function Templates, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It manages a collection of books, performing various operations on the libraryâ€™s catalog using STL containers and algorithms.

## Key Features
### Object Oriented Programming
- **Classes**: Utilizes Inheritance and Polymorphism to create a robust system architecture.
- **Class and Function Templates**: Implements templates to create flexible and reusable code.

### Search and Sort Functions
- **View entire catalog sorted by title**: Allows users to view the catalog, filtered by various categories such as title or genre.
- **Search for an item**: Provides functionality to search for specific books within the catalog.
  
### Edit Catalog Functions
- **Add and Remove items**: Users can add new books to the catalog or remove existing ones.

### Data Storage
The system uses STL vectors and maps to store and manage the catalog of books efficiently.

## Program Flow
The `main()` function manages user interactions by displaying available options and invoking the corresponding functions based on the user's choice. The application continues to operate in a loop until the user opts to exit.
